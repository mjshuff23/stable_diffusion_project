# Multimodal LLM: Text-to-Image Generation and Conversational AI

This project combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with image generation capabilities to create a multimodal AI capable of:

1. Generating images from textual prompts.
2. Engaging in natural language conversations.

## Features

- **Text-to-Image**: Generates high-quality images based on textual descriptions.
- **Chat**: Engages in conversations using a large language model.
- **Custom Dataset Support**: Fine-tunes models using datasets like Dragon Ball Z images.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- CUDA-enabled GPU (for optimal performance)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
